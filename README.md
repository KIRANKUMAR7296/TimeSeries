### Decomposition Model

`Additive` Model ( If Seasonality is `constant` ) : `Observation` = `Trend` + `Seasonality` + `Error`

```
Sales = Trend (Business Growth) + Seasonality (Weather) + Error (Theft / Calamity)
```

`Multiplicative` Model ( If Seasonality is `changing` ) : `Observation` = `Trend` * `Seasonality` * `Error`
